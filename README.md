Terra
The project you might have asked for,
but with noone actually doing something similar.

I do intend for this to be a 2D top-down explorer game (indeed a wordful).
As you read, it is made with Python/Cython,
because i have no motivation to move onto something more complex.

I use no game engine, building this game to my own liking.
I suspect i will incorporate simple AI neural networks for entities like livestock,
simple algorhitms for matters like map generation and such.
If you seek code to use for yourself, you surely can, but i doubt you will understand my work.
